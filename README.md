## Description

This script demonstrates the use of the `reduce` function from the `functools` module to calculate the sum of a list of numbers. The `reduce` function applies a specified function (in this case, a lambda function for addition) cumulatively to the elements of the iterable (`numbers` list), resulting in a single accumulated sum.

## Usage

To use this script, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Copy the code from the script and run it using a Python interpreter.

```bash
python sum_numbers.py
## Output

After running the script, you should see the calculated sum of the numbers printed to the console.

# Output: 15
